Sum of squares -- HyperFlow's "Hello World" workflow. 

Given a sequence of numbers, produces the sum of squares of every three of them. 

The squares are computed in parallel by the "Sqr" process. The "ordering" property enforces that the results are produced in the correct order (try running without it).
